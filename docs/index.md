# Pixi Build Backends

**Backend Implementations for Building Pixi Projects from Source**

Pixi Build Backends is a collection of specialized build backend implementations designed to facilitate building [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) packages directly from their source code.
These backends enable seamless integration with the Pixi ecosystem, supporting multiple programming languages and build systems while maintaining the conda ecosystem's cross-platform compatibility.

## üöÄ What Are Build Backends?

Build backends are executables that follow a specific protocol to decouple the building of conda packages from Pixi itself. This architecture allows for:

- **Language-specific optimization**: Each backend is tailored for specific programming languages and build tools
- **Modular design**: Backends can be developed, updated, and distributed independently
- **Extensibility**: New backends can be added without modifying Pixi core
- **Standardization**: All backends follow the same protocol and manifest specifications

## üì¶ Available Backends

The repository currently provides four specialized build backends:

| Backend   | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| [**`pixi-build-cmake`**](./backends/pixi-build-cmake.md) |  Projects using CMake |
| [**`pixi-build-python`**](./backends/pixi-build-python.md) | Building Python packages |
| [**`pixi-build-rattler-build`**](./backends/pixi-build-rattler-build.md) | Direct `recipe.yaml` builds with full control |
| [**`pixi-build-rust`**](./backends/pixi-build-rust.md) |  Cargo-based Rust applications and libraries |
| [**`pixi-build-mojo`**](./backends/pixi-build-mojo.md) |  Mojo applications and packages |

All backends are available through the [prefix.dev/conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) conda channel and work across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
For the latest backend versions, you can extend the channel list with the [prefix.dev/pixi-build-backends](https://prefix.dev/channels/pixi-build-backends) conda channel, here we push the latest versions of the backends.
