# Pixi Build Backends

**Backend Implementations for Building Pixi Projects from Source**

Pixi Build Backends is a collection of specialized build backend implementations designed to facilitate building [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) packages directly from their source code.
These backends enable seamless integration with the Pixi ecosystem, supporting multiple programming languages and build systems while maintaining the conda ecosystem's cross-platform compatibility.

## üöÄ What Are Build Backends?

Build backends are executables that follow a specific protocol to decouple the building of conda packages from Pixi itself. This architecture allows for:

- **Language-specific optimization**: Each backend is tailored for specific programming languages and build tools
- **Modular design**: Backends can be developed, updated, and distributed independently
- **Extensibility**: New backends can be added without modifying Pixi core
- **Standardization**: All backends follow the same protocol and manifest specifications

## üì¶ Available Backends

The repository currently provides the following specialized build backends:

| Backend   | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| [**`pixi-build-cmake`**](./backends/pixi-build-cmake.md) |  Projects using CMake |
| [**`pixi-build-python`**](./backends/pixi-build-python.md) | Building Python packages |
| [**`pixi-build-rattler-build`**](./backends/pixi-build-rattler-build.md) | Direct `recipe.yaml` builds with full control |
| [**`pixi-build-ros`**](./backends/pixi-build-ros.md) | ROS (Robot Operating System) packages |
| [**`pixi-build-rust`**](./backends/pixi-build-rust.md) |  Cargo-based Rust applications and libraries |
| [**`pixi-build-mojo`**](./backends/pixi-build-mojo.md) |  Mojo applications and packages |

All backends are available through the [prefix.dev/conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) conda channel and work across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
For the latest backend versions, you can extend the channel list with the [prefix.dev/pixi-build-backends](https://prefix.dev/channels/pixi-build-backends) conda channel, here we push the latest versions of the backends.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Check out our [tutorial series](https://pixi.sh/latest/build/getting_started/) to learn how to use `pixi build` in practice.

## üìö Key Concepts

-  [Compilers](./key_concepts/compilers.md)

    Learn how pixi-build integrates with conda-forge's compiler infrastructure to provide cross-platform, ABI-compatible builds. Covers compiler configuration, platform-specific behavior, and available compiler options for supported backends.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Rebuilding Generated Recipes

When you build a package using `pixi build`, the build backends generate a complete rattler-build recipe that is stored in your project's build directory. This can be useful for debugging build issues or understanding exactly how your package is being built.

### Recipe Locations

The build backends generate recipes in two locations:

#### 1. General Recipe (all outputs)

```
<your_project>/.pixi/build/work/<package-name>--<hash>/work/
```

This directory contains:

- `recipe.yaml` - A general recipe that can build all package outputs
- `variants.yaml` - All variant configurations for the package

#### 2. Variant-Specific Recipe (single output)

```
<your_project>/.pixi/build/work/<package-name>--<hash>/work/recipe/<variant_hash>/
```

This directory contains:

- `recipe.yaml` - The complete rattler-build recipe generated by the build backend
- `variants.yaml` - The variant configuration used for this specific build

### Rebuilding a Package

To debug or rebuild a package using the same configuration, you have two options:

### Option 1: Navigate to the recipe directory

1. Navigate to the recipe directory:
   ```bash
   cd .pixi/build/work/<package-name>--<hash>/work/recipe/<variant_hash>/
   ```

2. Use `rattler-build` to rebuild the package:
   ```bash
   rattler-build build
   ```

### Option 2: Point to the recipe directory

Use the `--recipe` flag to build without changing directories:

```bash
rattler-build build --recipe .pixi/build/work/<package-name>--<hash>/work/recipe/<variant_hash>/
```

This allows you to:

* Inspect the exact recipe that was generated
* Debug build failures with direct access to `rattler-build`
* Understand how the build backend translated your project model (`pixi.toml`)

!!! tip
    The `<variant_hash>` ensures that each unique combination of build variants gets its own recipe directory, making it easy to compare different build configurations.
